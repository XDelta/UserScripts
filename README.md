# UserScripts
Collection of some userscripts I've made

## Installation

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser of choice and then install the userscript you would like to use below:

### [DisableFocusCheck]
Webpages should always think they are in focus when using this.<br>
[Install the user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XDelta/UserScripts/main/DisableFocusCheck/DisableFocusCheck.user.js) with automatic updates.*<br>

### [MergeWithPreferredEmail]
Attempt to swap a merge on github to your preferred email to avoid accidently merging with another email address on your account.<br>
Remember to edit the script and set your preferred email.<br>
[Install the user.js](https://github.com/XDelta/UserScripts/raw/main/MergeWithPreferredEmail/MergeWithPreferredEmail.user.js) with automatic updates.*<br>

*Automatic updates from [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension, other loaders may vary.
